# Source Data

More information for each of these sources is found in the [paper](../paper/Zero-shot%20Log-based%20Anomaly%20Detection%20with%20LLM.pdf).

The [`build_scripts`](./build_scripts/) show how the compiled log for iptables was constructed. Paths have been reorganized, but I didn't check that the scripts would still run!
